# Fractal Generator 1.0

This program lets a user pick a known fractal set (such as the Mandelbrot set) and visualise it at a resolution they choose. The user can also click on an area that they'd like to zoom into, which re-renders the image; this can be done multiple times until the image loses clarity.

## How do I run this code?

The packages required to run this code are: matplotlib, numpy, pyfiglet (figlet), mpl-point-clicker and sys. You can then run the file through your terminal with 'python3 mandelbrot.py', then follow the instructions in the UI to generate your fractal.
