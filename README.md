# Fractal Generator 1.0

This program lets a user pick a known fractal set (such as the Mandelbrot set) and visualise it at a resolution they choose. The user can also click on an area that they'd like to zoom into, which re-renders the image; this can be done multiple times until the image loses clarity.
